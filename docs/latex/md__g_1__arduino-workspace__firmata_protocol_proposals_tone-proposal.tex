Add ability to call Arduino {\ttfamily tone} and {\ttfamily no\+Tone} functions. For non-\/\+Arduino architectures, similar functions to {\ttfamily tone} and {\ttfamily no\+Tone} would need to be implemented.

The duration could be extended if necessary. Duration could also be optional. If left out, the user would need to send the N\+O\+\_\+\+T\+O\+NE command to stop the tone.

An implementation of this proposal is currently available \href{https://github.com/firmata/arduino/compare/configurable...tone}{\texttt{ here}}.
