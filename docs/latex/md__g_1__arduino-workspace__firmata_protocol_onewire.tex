The idea is to configure Arduino Pins as One\+Wire Busmaster. The may be more than one pin configured for One\+Wire and there may be more than one device connected to such a pin.

Each one-\/wire-\/device has a unique identifier which is 8 bytes long and comes factory-\/programmed into the the device. To scan all devices connected to a pin configured for onewire a S\+E\+A\+R\+C\+H-\/request message is sent. The response contains all addresses of devices found. Having the address of a device One\+Wire-\/command-\/messages may be sent to this device.

The actual commands executed on the One\+Wire-\/bus are \textquotesingle{}reset\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}skip\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}select\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}read\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}delay\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}write\textquotesingle{} All these commands may be executed with a single One\+Wire-\/command-\/message. The subcommand-\/byte contains these commands bit-\/encoded. The data required to execute each bus-\/command must only be included in the message when the corresponding bit is set.

The order of execution of bus commands is\+: \textquotesingle{}reset\textquotesingle{}-\/$>$\textquotesingle{}skip\textquotesingle{}-\/$>$\textquotesingle{}select\textquotesingle{}-\/$>$\textquotesingle{}write\textquotesingle{}-\/$>$\textquotesingle{}read\textquotesingle{}-\/$>$\textquotesingle{}delay\textquotesingle{} (remember\+: each of these steps is optional. Also some combinations don\textquotesingle{}t make sense and in fact are mutual exclusive in terms of One\+Wire bus protocol, so you cannot run a \textquotesingle{}skip\textquotesingle{} followed by a \textquotesingle{}select\textquotesingle{}) The delay is useful for One\+Wire-\/commands included into taskdata (see \href{https://github.com/firmata/protocol/blob/master/scheduler.md}{\texttt{ Firmata-\/scheduler proposal}}).

Some One\+Wire-\/devices require some time to carry out e.\+g. a a/d-\/conversion after receiving the appropriate command. Including a delay into a One\+Wire-\/message saves some bytes in the taskdata (in comparism to the inclusion of a \textquotesingle{}delay\+\_\+task\textquotesingle{} scheduler message). One\+Wire Read-\/ and Read\+Reply messages are correlated using a correlationid (16bits). The reply contains the correlationid-\/value that was sent with the original request.
