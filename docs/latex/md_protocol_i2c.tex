Enables communication with I2C devices. Currently only supports one I2C port per board.

Added in Firmata protocol version 2.\+1.\+0.\hypertarget{md_protocol_i2c_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{I2\+C read/write request}\label{md_protocol_i2c_autotoc_md29}
Updated in Firmata 2.\+5.\+1 to enable setting auto-\/restart by setting bit 6 of byte 3.

A note about read/write modes (above). The {\ttfamily read continuously} mode indicates that the firmware should continuously read the device at the rate specified by the \href{https://github.com/firmata/protocol/blob/master/protocol.md}{\texttt{ sampling interval}}. A firmware implementation should support read continuous mode for several I2C devices simultaneously. Sending the {\ttfamily stop reading} command will end read continuous mode for that particular device.

{\itshape auto-\/restart (byte 3, bit 6) is needed by some devices such as the M\+M\+A8452Q accelerometer and the M\+P\+L3115\+As altimeter}\hypertarget{md_protocol_i2c_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{I2\+C reply}\label{md_protocol_i2c_autotoc_md30}

The optional {\ttfamily Delay} is for I2C devices that require a delay between when the register is written to and the data in that register can be read.
